```
docker command:
docker run --rm -it -v edirtegna_images:/data alpine sh

what it does? -

Launches an interactive shell (sh) inside a lightweight Alpine container, with a Docker volume (edirtegna_images) mounted at /data. Once you exit the shell, the container is automatically removed.

This is often used for:

Inspecting contents of a volume.

Doing quick command-line tasks.

Testing something in a clean Linux environment.
